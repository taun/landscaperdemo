title: "What kind of Fractals does FractalScapes make?"
---

FractalScapes uses a method developed by a Hungarian botanist named Aristid Lindenmayer. His method was a set of rules to model the growth of plants and other organisms. This is also known as an L-System fractal generator. 

Most fractal applications just visualize the Mandelbrot set which is the equivalent of flying over a landscape. All that really changes is the coloring. FractalScapes lets you create new never seen before fractals just by changing the rules.
