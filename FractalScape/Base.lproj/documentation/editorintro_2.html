      <h1 class="fheading1">How to play with fractals</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Now that you know a little about what an L-System fractal is and how it is created, we can explain what you can do with FractalScapes.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">As explained in the previous page, the fractal is basically <span class="paragraph-text-3">lines</span> and <span class="paragraph-text-4">turns</span>. What you don’t yet know is all of the turns are the same angle called appropriately enough, the “<span class="paragraph-text-5">turn angle</span>” and all of the lines are drawn in the same “<span class="paragraph-text-6">line color</span>” and “<span class="paragraph-text-7">line thickness</span>”. When you get more advanced you can see how to change these within the drawing of a fractal, but for now we are going to simplify and say there is one angle, color and thickness for a fractal. You can start playing with fractals in FractalScapes immediately by dragging your finger on the screen and so changing a sample fractal’s angle, thickness and for some samples, the color hue of the line or fill.</p>

      </h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The image shows the controls for playing with the fractal. From top to bottom.</p>
      <ul class="unorder-list">
        <li>Top left corner - shows which properties are changed by dragging your finger horizontally or vertically. In the example, horizontal drags change the turn angle which is currently 60 degrees. Vertical drags changes the line thickness which is currently 3.43 pixels. You can tap the 10x button to drag values 10 times faster.</li>
        <li>Top right - change the level of detail. The current level is 5.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Drag your finger to change the currently selected drag values.</li>
        <li>The blue tool bar allows you to select which values are changed by dragging your finger. Currently selected is shown by the white dot and it is “turn angle &amp; thickness”. The image shows the other possibilities.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Autoscale - scales the fractal to fill the canvas.</li>
        <li>Effects - add cool effects with the editor and turn them all on or off with this switch.</li>
        <li>&lt; | Trigger the Editor pop-up. See the next page for how to use the editor.<br>
