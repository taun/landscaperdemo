      <p class="paragraph paragraph-2">I would never have become interested in fractals if not for the book “The Science of Fractal Images” edited by Heinz-Otto Peitgen &amp; Dieter Saupe, in 1990. &nbsp;For someone who has always been interested in computer graphics, this book was pure gold and helped me write my first L-Systems fractal app in Smalltalk. That original app was used to create designs for Christmas cards. Hard to believe that was 25 years ago.</p>

      <h1 class="fheading1">Philly Cocoaheads Chapter</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">I would like to thank all the people at PhillyCocoa for the invaluable help in making FractalScapes a better app. They did much of the beta testing and gave lots of valuable feedback. There is still plenty of great feedback yet to be implemented, however as Steve Jobs said, “Real artists ship."</p>

      <h1 class="fheading1">Tanya Souvigny &amp; Bryn Chapman</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Tanya was my “I don’t know anything about computers or graphics” tester. Bryn was my representative 12 year old user. Almost all L-System fractal apps use the alphabet for representing fractal rules. For example, “F” means draw a line, “+” means turn. The L-System editors then let the user edit the rule string by typing things like “F+F—F+F”. Great for 1980. The first iteration of FractalScapes used this same dated interface. It was Tanya who first suggested replacing the text rules with draggable tiles. It would be nice to go all the way to a true graphic representation of the rules but the number one device for FractalScapes is the iPhone and the tile &amp; row representation is much more compact than a full graphic representation of the rules. Perhaps in the future, the iPad version will get the full graphic editor treatment.</p>
