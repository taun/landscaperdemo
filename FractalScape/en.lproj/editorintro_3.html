      <h1 class="fheading1">How to edit a fractal</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Now you know how to play with the fractal by changing the angle and line thickness by dragging with your finger. We get to the more advanced editing. Using the editor popup, you can edit colors, filters, name, description, and with an in-app purchase, the rules.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="row content">
    <div class="coffee-span-12 coffee-700-span-6">
      <p class="paragraph">There are 3 main editors in the editor pop-up.</p>
      <ul class="unorder-list">
        <li><span class="bold">Colors</span> - for changing the line, fill &amp; page color.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Effects</span> - for adding and removing cool filter effects.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Rules</span> - for creating new never before seen fractals or just experimenting with the sample fractals. The rules editor is read-only if you haven’t bought the in-app purchase. This lets you see the rules used to create the fractal but not change them.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph">All the editors work the same way. They all have “tiles” which represent possible colors, rules or effects. They all have 2 parts. A large source of tiles at the bottom and one or more destinations at the top. Possible destinations highlight in blue when dragging a tile. To change the fractal, you just move tiles around.</p>

      <h6>Moving Tiles - Press hold, drag, drop</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">As shown in the animation, all tiles are moved the same way, press and hold your finger on a tile to be moved. When a new tile pops-up, it is ready to be moved. Without lifting your finger, drag the tile to the desired destination. You can see the effect of the tile live. So you can see what would happen if you were to drop the tile without needing to drop the tile. Once you are happy, drop the tile to make the change permanent. To <span class="paragraph-text-1">remove</span> a tile from a destination, press and hold, drag it out of the destination and drop it anywhere but a highlighted destination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-12 coffee-700-span-6">
      <p class="paragraph">Why press, hold, drag, drop? It was decided to use the press and hold gesture so we can tell the difference between the user trying to scroll the view and trying to move an individual tile.</p>
