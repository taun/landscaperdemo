      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">FractalScapes let's you create new colorful and amazing fractal plants and patterns. You don't need to be an artist to create cool looking designs.&nbsp;If your are into fractals already, FractalScapes is the only iOS fractal editor with <span class="paragraph-text-9">drag and drop interactive rule editing</span>. If you are new to fractals, FractalScapes draws a special kind of fractal known as <span class="paragraph-text-2">L-System</span> fractals. These were first created around 1968 by&nbsp;<span class="paragraph-text-8">Aristid Lindenmayer</span>, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. These are very different from the Mandelbrot set most people are familiar with.<br>
      </p>
      <h1 class="fheading1">How do L-Systems Work?</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">L-System fractals are created&nbsp;in two steps:</p>
      <ol class="order-list">
        <li>Starting Rules (axiom) - The fractal is defined using a starting sequence of simple drawing rules and optional additional replacement rules. The drawing rules are like a mini-graphics language.</li>
        <li>Replacement rules - The key to the L-System fractal is the replacement rules. The replacement rules show how to replace each rule in the starting rules. On the left side of the replacement rule is the rule to be replaced. On the right side is the new rules to be used in place each occurence of the right side replacement rule. Each time the replacement rules are applied, is one level of detail. The more times we apply the replacement rules, the more detail in the fractal.&nbsp;</li>
