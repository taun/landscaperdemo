        <li>Every fractal is defined by a set of drawing rules, angle, color and thickness.</li>
        <li>Fractal angles and thickness and some colors can be changed by <span class="bold">dragging your finger</span> on the screen.</li>
        <li>Pop-up the editor to change the colors, effects and rules using <span class="bold">press-hold-drag-drop</span>.</li>
        <li>Copy a fractal before changing it if you want to create a new different fractal.</li>
        <li>Export fractals to show friends your creation. In-app purchase for exporting as PDF vector and to remove the FractalScapes watermark.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Share fractals to the cloud for others to appreciate, download and edit. In-app purchase required for cloud sharing but not to download from the FractalScapes cloud.<br>
